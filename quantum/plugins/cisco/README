 L2 Network Plugin
==================

*** Current support for UCS (blade servers) with M81KR VIC (Palo) for 802.1Qbh ***
*** Also supports Nexus 7k ***

** Pre-requisities
* UCS B200 series blades with M81KR VIC installed.
* UCSM 2.0 (Capitola) Build 230
* RHEL 6.1
* UCS & VIC installation (support for KVM) - please consult the accompanying installation guide available at:
http://wikicentral.cisco.com/display/GROUP/SAVBU+Palo+VM-FEX+for+Linux+KVM

* If you have a Nexus switch in your topology and decide to turn on Nexus support, you will need:
	- ncclcient v0.3.1 - Python library for NETCONF clients (http://schmizz.net/ncclient/).
	- paramiko library (do: yum install python-paramiko.noarch)

* To run Quantum on RHEL, you will need to have the correct version of python-routes (version 1.12.3 or later). The RHEL 6.1 package contains an older version. Do the following and check your python-routes version:
rpm -qav | grep "python-routes"

If it's an older version, you will need to upgrade to 1.12.3 or later. One quick way to do it as by adding the following to your /etc/yum.repos.d/openstack.repo (assuming that you had installed OpenStack on this host, and hence had this repo; else you could add to any other operational repo config), and then update the python-routes package. That should get you the python-routes-1.12.3-2.el6.noarch package.

** Plugin Installation Instructions:
* Make a backup copy of quantum/quantum/plugins.ini, and edit the "provider" entry to point to the L2Network-plugin:
provider = quantum.plugins.cisco.l2network_plugin.L2Network

* All configuration files are located under quantum/plugins/cisco/conf. Wherever you find <put_something_here> kind of placeholder, please replace it entirely with the relevant values (don't forget to remove the angle brackets as well) 

* If you are not running Quantum on the same host as the OpenStack Cloud Controller, you will need to change the db_ip_address configuration in nova.ini

* If you want to turn on Nexus support, please uncomment the nexus_plugin property in the plugins.ini file, and enter the relevant configuration in the nexus.ini file. In addition, you will require a patch to the ncclient library. Also make sure that the switch's host key is known to the host on which you are running the Quantum service (since the connection to the switch is over ssh). If you are not turning the Nexus support on, your Nexus configuration will be ignored.

* Check again if you have gone through every conf file and made the required changes (check if all IP addresses are correct, and check if you have entered the credentials correponding to each of those IP addresses in the credentials.ini file).
                    	
* Start the Quantum service

** Additional installation required on Nova Compute:
* Create DB Table in Nova DB (On the Cloud Controller)
mysql -uroot -p<mysql_password_here> nova -e 'create table ports (port_id VARCHAR(255) primary key, profile_name VARCHAR(255), dynamic_vnic VARCHAR(255), host VARCHAR(255), instance_name VARCHAR(255), instance_nic_name VARCHAR(255), used tinyint(1));'

* Replace the following files with the files from the Cisco Nova branch:
/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/nova/virt/libvirt_conn.py

* Add the following files from the Cisco Nova branch:
/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/nova/virt/cisco_ucs.py

* Restart nova-compute service
